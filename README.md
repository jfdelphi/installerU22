Goal: Let's pour our heart and soul into creating installers that:

- Work perfectly and exclusively on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
- Run smoothly on fresh installations, no matter what.
- Check every prerequisite to ensure nothing breaks.
- Verify success so we can trust everything is in place.
- Capture every error in detailed logs to make troubleshooting easier.

Help: Iâ€™m reaching out because I need your support to make this happen!
